 *
 * This works from where each line actually sits. The page is cut into bands at
 * every full-width line; each band is grouped into columns by horizontal
 * overlap; then bands are read top to bottom, columns left to right, and lines
 * within a column top to bottom.
 *
 * **The result is only reordered when a band genuinely looks like columns** —
 * two or more, each with at least [MIN_LINES_PER_COLUMN] lines. Anything else,
 * including every single-column page, comes back exactly as it was given. This
 * can make a real multi-column page better; it cannot make an ordinary page
